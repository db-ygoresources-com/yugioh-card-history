You can banish this card and any number of \"Cubic\" monsters from your Graveyard, then target face-up monsters your opponent controls equal to the number of those banished \"Cubic\" monsters; place 1 Cubic Counter on each of them. (Monsters with a Cubic Counter cannot attack, also negate their effects.)"
