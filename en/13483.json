During the next Standby Phase, return that banished monster to the field, and if you do, its ATK becomes double its original ATK until the end of that turn. If 1 or more \"Ancient Gear Golem\" or \"Ancient Gear Golem - Ultimate Pound\" you control would be destroyed by battle or card effect, you can banish this card from your GY instead."
