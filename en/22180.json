You can banish this card from your GY, then target 1 face-up monster you control; equip it with up to 2 Equip Spells with different names from your hand and/or GY that can equip to it, but any battle damage it inflicts to your opponent is halved while equipped with a card by this effect. You can only use 1 \"Arsenal Audit\" effect per turn, and only once that turn."
