That equipped monster gains ATK equal to the combined ATK of all Dragon Synchro Monsters in your GY. Each time that equipped monster destroys an opponent's monster by battle: You can banish 1 Dragon Synchro Monster from your GY; that equipped monster can attack an opponent's monster again in a row."
