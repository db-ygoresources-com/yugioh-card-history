If a face-up \"Icejade\" monster you control leaves the field by an opponent's card, except by being destroyed (and except during the Damage Step): You can banish this card from your GY, then target 1 card your opponent controls; banish it. You can only use each effect of \"Icejade Manifestation\" once per turn."
